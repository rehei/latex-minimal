# Overview

This project aims to provide a minimal latex setup with a nice versionable spellchecking support using aspell.

# Build
Create a PDF-File of the tex-file by using:
```
$ ./build.sh
```

# Spellcheck

Create a spellcheck of the tex-file by using:
```
$ ./spellcheck.sh
```
Added words are stored in the dictionary.txt file and, thus, can easily be versioned.
